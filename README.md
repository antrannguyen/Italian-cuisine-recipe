# Italian-cuisine-recipe
An application that fetches the data from an API and allows the users to search recipes, update serving sizes, add recipes to a shopping cart, and press “like buttons” for recipes.
I used open APIs and they only have PIZZA on the list, so please try out with all kind of pizza you wish.
